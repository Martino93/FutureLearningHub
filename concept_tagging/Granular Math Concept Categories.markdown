### Notes on Usage
- **Multiple Concepts**: Questions can be tagged with multiple categories. For example, a problem requiring solving linear equations and understanding domain might be tagged with "Solving linear equations" and "Domain and range."
- **Hierarchy**: Categories can roll up to broader areas (e.g., "Solving linear equations" under "Algebra") for flexible analysis.
- **Specificity**: These subtopics are detailed enough to identify specific skills while remaining manageable.

This list can be tailored further based on a specific syllabus or dataset, ensuring alignment with educational goals.
